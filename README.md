This is a project made to read the ambient temperature in a room, record it, and show it on a website. The website shows the current temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit as well as graphing the last 24 hours of temperatures. The graphs take the temperature reading from every 30 minutes to allow for accurate temperature readings as well as a broad span of time.
